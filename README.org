* cljwebsword
Web-based Bible Application using Clojure and JSword (Using Immutant)
** Installation
   TODO: Untested directions (THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE)
*** You'll need:
    1. Java 8
    2. Maven 3+
    3. Leiningen 2+
*** Install Latest Jsword SNAPSHOT with Maven
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone https://github.com/crosswire/jsword.git
    cd jsword
    mvn install -DskipTests=true
    #+END_SRC

    If, for whatever reason, the latest JSword ceases to work with this code,
    you can download my fork of Jsword and switch to the v2.1 branch and install
    it from there.
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    https://github.com/timotheosh/jsword.git
    cd jsword
    git checkout v2.1
    mvn install -DskipTests=true
    #+END_SRC
*** Clone this repo and then compile
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/timotheosh/cljwebsword.git
cd cljwebsword
lein immutant war
#+END_SRC
*** Install war file in JBoss/Wildfly
NOTE: Tested only in Wildfly

The war file can be found under target/default/cljwebsword.war
You will need a Crosswire Sword Installation with some texts already installed and accessible to the JBoss/Widlfly user.
